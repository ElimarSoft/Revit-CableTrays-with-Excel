### 🧰 Key Tips Recap

- **Vertical Tray Orientation**  
  Since vertical trays lack a defined horizontal orientation, they can behave unpredictably unless:
  - Connected to a fitting  
  - Given a slight inclination

- **Excel Programming Workaround**  
  To define vertical trays:
  - Apply a **0.1% advance** in the layout direction  
  - This tiny nudge helps Revit determine the tray’s axis rotation

- **Dynamo Player Load Delay**  
  After launching Revit:
  - **Dynamo Player may take time to initialize**, causing macro execution delays or failures
  - First-run macros might time out or misfire due to this lag
