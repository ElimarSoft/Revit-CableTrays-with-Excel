# Revit-CableTrays-with-Excel<br>
Design Revit CableTrays from Excel Data Tables<br>

The KIT is composed of en Excel Workbook with the following Sheets<br>

- Readme: Instructions page.<br>
- LineDataIn: Sheet to fill with CableTray parameters to be used by DrawTrays Dynamo.<br>
- LineDataOut: Position Data generated by DrawTrays Dynamo.<br>
- TypeData: Type information from the Document that is generated by GetCadData Dynamo.<br>
- Levels: Displays information about avalable levels also generated by GetCadData Dynamo.<br>
- Data: Information about actual CableTray data in the Document generated by CableTrayRoute Dynamo.<br>

## This Project is intended for Electrical Engineers that need to design cable trays for BIM projects. The requirements are:
- 1.	Calculate Cable Lengths: Determine cable lengths based on tray routes.
- 2.	Calculate Cable Weight: Measure cable weight per tray meter (Not implemented yet).
- 3.	Calculate Tray Occupation: Evaluate tray occupation based on local regulations (Not implemented yet).
- 4.	Tray Inventory: Create an inventory of required trays, including straight pieces and fittings, anticipating Tray mechanical adjustments.
- 5.	Calculate Installation Cost: Estimate the total installation cost.

### Scenario 1: Trays are Already Designed
##### Objective: Calculate tray routes length by reading information from the Revit Doc database.
- 1.	Extract Tray Route Information from Revit:
Use Revit API to extract the lengths of cable trays from the Revit document.
- 2.	Calculate Tray Routes:
Sum the lengths of the individual tray segments to get the total route length.
### Scenario 2: Designing Cable Tray Runs Using the Tool
##### Objective: Design cable tray runs by entering route data in Excel as coordinates, and automatically draw trays with this information.
- 1.	Input Route Data in Excel:
Enter the coordinates of the tray routes in an Excel sheet.
- 2.	Automatically Draw Trays:
Develop a script (e.g., using Python and Revit API) to read the Excel data and create the cable tray elements in Revit.
- 3.	Control and Inventory:
Use the data from Excel to accurately control the lengths and inventory of cable trays, ensuring this information is up-to-date.
